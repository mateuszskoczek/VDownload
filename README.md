## App development

VDownload is a project, which I develop in my free time as a hobby and a form of learning.

As the application is not 100% resistant to external factors (e.g. changes in services APIs) and to be fair to creators and video services, it is available for free with open source code. 

If you want to support me and the development of the project you can:
- **Donate me** via Paypal (link in the "Sponsor this project" section in Github repository and in the app itself in the "About" page)
- **Report bugs and errors** in the "Issues" section of Github repository
- **Propose new features and support of video services** in the "Issues" section of Github repository
- **Translate the application into a language you know**
